# UnitTesting

If you'd like to manually run your tests (e.g. if they didn't run automatically when you committed, or you want to check before you commit), here are the steps to follow.

# Navigate to your folder in the Terminal
Use the change directory command (`cd`) to get **inside** of the automated test folder:
![cd](https://github.com/CPSC-1520/UnitTesting/assets/55507008/764e5e9f-d829-47ec-a6cf-7848eca644d7)

# Install dependencies
From within that folder, run the `npm install` command:
![install](https://github.com/CPSC-1520/UnitTesting/assets/55507008/93b1f573-c715-4981-821e-295cb807aacf)

# Run the tests
Finally, in the same folder, run the `npm run start-and-open` command. This will automatically launch Cypress. Click E2E testing, choose your browser, and click on the tests you'd like to run:
![run](https://github.com/CPSC-1520/UnitTesting/assets/55507008/d5c4d4b0-f5b7-4af9-bbaa-5f84e83e1f4b)
